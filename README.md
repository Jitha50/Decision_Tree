# Decision_Tree
Decison Tree is a <b>supervised Machine learning algorithm</b> that ca be used ffpr both classififcation and regression problems, but mostly it is preffereed for solving classification problems. It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes the features of a dataset, branches represent the decison rules and each leaf node represent the outcome.

In a decision tree, there are two nodes, whihc are the Decision nodes and Leaf Node. Decision nodes are used to make any decision and have multiple branches whereas Leaf nodes are the output of those decisions and do not contain any further branches. it is calles a decision tree because, similar to a tree it starts with the root node and which expands on further branhes and construct a tree like structure.
